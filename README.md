# csv2json
This repo contains 2 files, one is the main file containing the logic for coverting the csv into the Json format. The other one is the CSV file on which the code has been build.

Steps to execute for a non technical person:
Download the zip file from git.
Extact all in a folder.
Click on the main.exe file.
A window will open. Click on Uplaod button to uplaod the CSV.
The CSV is in the same folder where you have extracted it.
As soon as you will click on open, the code will run in the background and will generate the Json file in txt format.
Close the app after that.
